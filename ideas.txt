different starting zones:

forest, desert, tundra, swamp, mountains, coastal

different groups of people
capital cities for each different group of people
smaller villages and towns in the outskirts of the cities

the dessert capital city should be built inside a mesa, like the peoples palace of d'hara in
the sword of truth series.

the swamp capital should be a sprawling tree house city

Tundra city could be made of ice or have ice walls as defences

mountain capital like minas tirith, maybe volcano nearby, hot springs? maybe japanese minas tirith
possibly moria style halls half in the mountain too

coastal city could be half on land and half on floating pontoons in the sea

must include sky peoples capital city in the clouds, and the merfolk city under the sea,
same for the demonkin within a hell plane, and the voidspawn in the void.
