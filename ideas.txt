World made up of multiple continents amd islands
Not all of the world has been colonised, but magical creatures reside in those hidden places
Empty space between cities/towns/villages, should have frequent points of interest like caves 
and dens etc


different starting zones:

forest, desert, tundra, swamp, mountains, coastal,

different groups of people
capital cities for each different group of people
smaller villages and towns in the outskirts of the cities

the desert capital city should be built inside a mesa, like the peoples palace of d'hara in
the sword of truth series, maybe tunnels to other mesas

the swamp capital should be a sprawling tree house city

Tundra city could be made of ice or have ice walls as defences

mountain capital like minas tirith, maybe volcano nearby, hot springs? maybe japanese minas tirith
possibly moria style halls half in the mountain too.

coastal city could be half on land and half on floating pontoons in the sea

must include sky peoples capital city in the clouds, and the merfolk city under the sea,
same for the demonkin within a hell plane, and the voidspawn in the void.

First playthrough should be in the main starter area, other starter areas unlocked via progression 
through the game, maybe from reputation, maybe from a quest. Same goes for classes, at the beginning
there should only be limited choices, but as new milestones reached ingame it unlocks other classes
that can be selected at the start of the game.

Choices made during character creation decide future events, for example if the player chooses 
strength based options, then once they awake they will be offered the job with the blacksmith,
if dexterity options are chosen then work at the fletchers would be offered, if stelth options
are chosen then the player would be offered a job with the towns hunters. This should also effect
choices further along than just the starter area, not sure yet how far reaching and impactful these
differences will be.

one group of people, maybe the desert people, should be like the imperial order in the sword of truth
series; thinking that nobody should be above another, people shouldn't be proud of success, it only shows
they need to give more to the needy, depicts people as being evil with a lifetime of suffering to apease
the gods so that they will have a good afterlife. this makes people that follow their beliefs into brutes
that will do any evil to spread their words to any unbelievers. basically communism/socialism.

another group of people, lets say the mountain men of the far north, will be inspired by the chronicles
of riddick, these people believe in strength over all, you keep what you kill, if you are strong enough
to kill the king that makes you the king, you like a sword that somebody has, kill them, if you can, and 
take it. this makes ruthless killers that only value the oppinion of stronger people or their equals, 
but look down on everybody else, the weak live by the grace of the strong, and they should be thankful
for whatever the strong choose to let them keep, they believe that only the strong will gain eternal
glory in the afterlife, where they contine to battle for eternity, where at the end of each day, all
the fallen rise back up where they all drink and feast, only for the eternal battle to start again the
following day (viking mythology)

another group of people, the standard forest dwelling starter area people, should value hard work and
respect of all people, everybody has the same chances in life, you just have to work hard and you will
earn your way, family units are strong and the local community benefits from good values and social
cohesion, there by making their country as a whole productive and prosperous. these people depict 
themselfs in giant glorious statues showing the strong spirit and resolve of the valiant, showing
a great reverance of life and the light, believing in all that is good. (capitalism)
