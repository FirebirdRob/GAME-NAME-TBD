A Game that should be:

Scrolls like:

Open world, story driven, player choices change the world around them,
many different 'endings' to be discovered

Souls like:

Dynamic combat that is both challenging and engaging, death is to be expected

Plus my own inspiration:

Constructable houses, towns, and cities, as long as appropriate reputaition level
No player level, power being determined by skill levels, item quality, and player ability
Deliberately impossible boss fights, until you return later
Random boss encounters, with various triggers, each playthrough will be unique
Certain character creation aspects not available until world milestones reached in a playthrough
Players able to become rediculously overpowered by meticulous training
The player isn't the only 'main character' but hears of their exploits, maybe encounter them as end boss
